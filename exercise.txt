Stock number exercise:
----------------------------------------------

This exercise consist in two parts, the first one is creating the functions to read a csv file.
This function will be used in the second part to create some stock numbers for artworks.
Feel free to change the args and kwargs of the example functions below, these are only meant as a guide and they 
can be split in more functions to make it easier to undestand.


1. Create the functions to read the csv file in '/lib/csv'.
	
	csv_to_rows: Converts csv file to list of dicts.
	rows_to_csv: Takes list of dictionaries and filepath and outputs a spreadsheet
	Feel free to add more functionsn to make the code more clear and use any external library like pandas, csv, ...



2. Generate a new spreadsheet with new stock numbers for the existing artworks and all the data from the csv?

	A sock number tends to consist of 2 parts:
	
		SA 001
	
	The first part is the prefix (SA)
	The second part is the number part (001).
	It is important that these are unique as we use these to identify artworks. 
	
	Using the functions you have made in the previous exercise, create the code for create_new_stock_numbers.
	
	The new prefix created should follow this pattern:
	
		first letter of the artist's first name
		first letter of the artist's last name
	
	
	e.g.
		Kadeem Darzi, 'KAD 001' ----> new stock number = 'KD 001'
		Kadeem Darzi 'KAD 0002' ----> new stock number = 'KD 002'
		James Perrogi 'JAM 001' = 'JP 001'

	General things to consider:

		What if the artist only has one name e.g. 'Cher' (you will need to consider a rule to try and create a sensible prefix for this 'CH')
		What if the artist has multiple names e.g. 'Johnn F Kennedy' (perhaps a sensible prefix would be 'JK')
		Two artists can not have the same prefix, 
			Kadeem Darzi, 'KD 001'
			Katherine Dean, 'KA 001' (taking the next letter of the name and check is unique again)
